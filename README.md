# Mini Data Analysis Project - Cancer Detection

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of the `cancer_sample` dataset from the `datateachr` package. The analysis investigates which tumor characteristics best distinguish between malignant and benign cancer diagnoses.

## Goal

Identify key tumor measurements that can effectively differentiate malignant from benign breast tumors to support early cancer detection research.

## Research Questions

1. Do malignant tumors have significantly larger measurements (radius, area, perimeter) compared to benign tumors?

2. Are certain shape characteristics (concavity, symmetry, compactness) better indicators of malignancy than size measurements alone?

3. What are the critical threshold values for radius and concavity that best separate malignant from benign tumors?

4. Which combination of 2-3 tumor measurements provides the clearest separation between malignant and benign diagnoses?
